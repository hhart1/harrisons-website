          <p> Harrison Hart is a Baltimore native who has grown a love for photography and film making. Harrison is currently pursuing a degree in Photography and Electronic Media & Film from Towson University. Growing up with a camera in hand, he has documented the world through his own lens - taking pictures all throughout Europe, Africa, South America, and North America. He specializes in photographing events, portraits, weddings, sports, and landscapes. </p>

          <p> Harrison has been flying drones for a couple of years now and loves to capture anything from above. Aside from the camera, he co-founded The South African Lacrosse Project, a non-profit started in 2007 that betters the lives of South African children affected by HIV/AIDS through the sport of lacrosse. </p>
